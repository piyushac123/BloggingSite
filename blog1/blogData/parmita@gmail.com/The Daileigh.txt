The Daileigh’s Ashleigh Hutchinson offers articles and courses to help her readers build the perfect closet. She aims to help women aged 20-70 to create a style they love. Ashleigh includes quite a few fashion eBooks on her site, as well as blog posts and beautiful fashion photography. She even holds online webinars to help people improve their fashion sense.

The Daileigh is very much Ashleigh’s per project. She stresses that she built the site herself, without a team. She does acknowledge the support of her family and friends, however.
