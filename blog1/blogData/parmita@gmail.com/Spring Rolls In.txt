All afternoon and into the evening, bands of thunderstorms have rolled across central Missouri, bringing warm, moist air and intermittent rain to the wintry landscape.  In concert, the lawns have greened and the first blossoms now adorn our magnolias.

While snowmelt and heavy rains across Nebraska and the Dakotas has produced flooding in the Missouri River Valley, most of the regional landscape has remained relatively dry and today's storms may signal a transition to more seasonal conditions.  The leafing of shrubs and small trees will likely commence in the next few days, well behind schedule.

Then again, the thunderstorms are developing ahead of an approaching cold front, which will sweep cooler and drier air into the region; afternoon highs are forecast to remain in the forties (F) over the coming weekend.  As we are reminded each year, the fickle weather of March must run its course before spring can truly take hold.
