Returning to Colorado, I found clumps of deep-blue Scilla siberica adorning sun-exposed areas of our Littleton farm.  These showy bulb plants are always the first flowers to appear on the property, often blooming by mid February.

Native to southwest Russia and eastern Europe, this wildflower is commonly known as Siberian squill (though it is not native to that region).  Now planted in gardens across the globe, scilla readily naturalizes by both seed and bulb offsets, producing carpets of blue in woodlands and fields alike.  These wildflowers favor full-sun and well-drained soil but adapt to a variety of conditions.

By late March, Siberian squill, grape hyacinths, dandelions, wild cherry shrubs and apricot trees are all usually blooming on the farm.  Due to extreme cold and heavy snow in late winter, however, spring color is well behind schedule this year, making the beautiful clumps of scilla especially welcome.
